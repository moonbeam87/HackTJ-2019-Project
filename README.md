# HackTJ 2019 Project
Old Unity Game I made in about 20 hours on March of 2019 for the HackTJ Hackathon

Game is called "Geo Dash"

Tap 1 Finger to Jump, 2 fingers to reset to level 1 if you get stuck

Camera Viewpoint still shifts around, as of now, it's a feature, not a bug :)

I will hopefully get around to making this more refined in the summer as right now it's still a little rough
